## Text summarization

### Introduction

- There are two main types of summarization
    - Abstractive Summarization
      - select words based on semantic understanding, even those words did not appear in the source documents. It aims at producing important material in a new way. 

    - Extractive Summarization
      - attempt to summarize articles by selecting a subset of words that retain the most important points.
